=================

Charting components for [Tapestry](http://tapestry.apache.org/) based on [gRaphaël](http://g.raphaeljs.com)

### Note, not fully implemented yet.

The idea is to provide a tapestry component library for rendering gRaphaël charts. Simple charts should not require any javascript coding. Charts can be decorated by a javascript ```postProcessor``` for advanced features such as animations.
